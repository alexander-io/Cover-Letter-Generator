<Mrs.> <insert_hiring_manager_name>,

My name is Alexander Braunschweig Harris.
I am from a small town in Wisconsin. I am pursuing a bachelors of science in computer science with a business emphasis at the University of Puget Sound in lovely Tacoma, Washington. I am currently a senior and I expect to graduate in ‘18.

During my last years in university I have found a home, friends, and mentors in the computer science department. When I imagine where I’ll find a comparable community with similar ideals, <insert_company_name> is at the head of my priority queue. I consider myself to be an excellent candidate for the <insert_position_title> position at <insert_company_name> because of my technical, communicative, professional, and dedicative ability.

The most impressionable courses I have taken have been in the computer science department. During this last spring semester of ‘17, I had the great fortune of taking Operating Systems (CS 475). I performed exceedingly well in the class relative to my peers and in terms of grade points. This course presented various programmatic challenges in the C programming language such as understanding how the operating system manages a multiplicity of programs/processes, understanding program optimization related to time-complexity, and working with the operating system as an interface between software & hardware. The skills & principles learned in this course allow me to work with competency and confidence in the Linux environment. As a result of this class, I have successfully implemented a virtual-memory-management simulator, a shell command line interface, and many routines which optimize the speed of programmatic tasks using multiple threads while enforcing execution ordering.

Concurrent with Operating Systems, I took Network Programming (CS 325) where I developed comprehension for the ways in which computers communicate using network layers & protocols. The coursework for this class consisted of socket programming using the Python programming language. Specifically, I have implemented a web server, caching web proxy server, torrent-client protocol, and reliable data transfer protocol as a result of this course. This class has provided me with proficiency in the Python language applied to network programming.

Database Management Systems (CS 455) acclimated me with fundamental principles including relational algebra, schema & design, query language (i.e., SQL), and compression algorithms & methodologies for database optimization. <TODO : write more on databases>

Finally, in Software Engineering (CS 340) I learned the intersection of the model, view, and controller using full-stack development (i.e., the MEAN stack : Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node). Through application of principles taught in this class I have improved my skill in making programming projects accessible to personal-computers and mobile devices on the internet. Additionally, I familiarized myself with industry standard group software development management techniques such as Agile development. The majority of this class was conducted in the JavaScript programming language, with which I have developed great dexterity. Lastly, through this course I furthered my experience with Git and GitHub and solidified my ability to use revision control technology while working on software effectively in teams.

Serving as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant has both improved the my efficiency of work and ability to verbally communicate technical concepts. My job responsibilities included both tutoring and grading for the university’s computer science department. Working as a subject tutor has improved my ability to distill concepts and algorithms to their component parts in order to communicate them verbally. Furthermore, working as a grader for Data-Structures (CS 261) has honed my efficiency in keystrokes and has been an excellent opportunity to practice offering constructive criticism to peers. These jobs have provided me with the tools necessary to thrive in any pressure filled environment in addition to communicate and cooperate effectively with others.
